perc_bar_drawer.c:

File whose sole responsibility is to create a percent bar.

Vars:

	+ Percbar_Info: struct containing info to create a percent bar. Contains the following vars:

		safe_percent: double
			How full the bar should be in percent. If get_safe_percent_from() is given an invalid
			fraction, this var is a default value instead.

		max_hashes: int
			Max # of hashes that can be in this percent bar (essentially, size of percent bar - 2 brackets)

		num_of_hashes: int
			# of hashes that are actually in this percent bar

Funcs:
	
	+ draw_percbar(char *buf, double *frac): void
		Draws the percent bar.

	- get_safe_percent_from(double frac): double
		If frac is < 0, or = -0.0, or not a number, returns 0
		If frac is > 1, returns 100
		Else, returns frac * 100 (i.e. fraction as a percent)

	- get_num_of_hashes_from(double safe_percent, int max_hashes): int
		returns the number of hashes this percent bar should have, based on safe_percent

	- fill_in_perc_bar(char *buf, Percbar_Info *pb_info): void
		fills in perc bar info

	- make_bar(char *buf, Percbar_Info *pb_info): void
		fills in the bar part of the percent bar

	- add_percent_string(char *buf, Percbar_Info *pb_info): void
		fills in the percent part of the percent bar
