 After finishing (sort of) Project 2, I learned a ton of things. In particular, I learned a couple of coding principles that might make codeing a lot smoother and maybe even faster.

So I\textquotesingle{}ve decided to rewrite this whole project more or less from scratch, using the following principles\+:


\begin{DoxyPre}
    1. Every file's functions and constant variables have a prefix. For example, functions in "{}linked\_list.c"{} would have the format "{}ll\_func\_name(...)"{}"{}
\begin{DoxyVerb} (Test funcs, however, have a different format: "test_prefix_func_name()")
\end{DoxyVerb}

    2. Single Responsibility Principle: If I'm storing a group of closely-\/related data and manipulating it w/ functions, it belongs in its own "{}class"{} (c file).

    3. Outlining: I work best when I have a clear outline and a good grasp on what everything does. Therefore, before I actually code any c files, I'm going to write an outline in VERY basic UML.

    Here's an exmaple w/ sample.c:


            (Note that C stands for const)
            Vars:
                    + a: type
                    + b: type

                    -\/ c: type
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item d: type

                    C e: const type 
                    C f: const type
                    C g: const type

            Funcs:
                    init\_data(): void
                    destroy\_data(): void
                    ...

\begin{DoxyVerb}4. Global and static vars: All files that keep track of global and static vars should organize it within a struct. Here's an example w/ sample.c 


        sample.h:
                typedef struct {
                        type a;
                        type b;
                } Sample_Public_Data;

                extern Sample_Public_Data* sample_globals;

        sample.c

                typedef struct {
                        type c;
                        type d;
            } Sample_Private_Data;

            // Constants go here
            const type e = ...;
            const type f = ...;
            const type g = ...;
            ...

            Sample_Public_Data* sample_globals;
            static Sample_Private_Data* sample_locals;


        // later...
        init_data() // Initializes public and private data
        destroy_data() // Resets and frees public and private data



5. Test EVERYTHING


        Every func in UML should have a test written for it
        Also, figure out how each given test works


        WRITE THE TEST FIRST, then write code around it
\end{DoxyVerb}

\begin{DoxyPre}
\begin{DoxyPre}
    1. Refactor the code using these new principles
    2. End up with clean(er) code and basic UML docs for every class
